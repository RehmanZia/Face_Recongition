# Face_Recongition
#There are two codes for face_Recogniton
# one is LBPH algorithm and other Face-recogniton library code
#If Face-Recogniton library is unable to install in your system and gives error.
#try dowloading visual studio community version and only c/c++ option for face-recogniton library to work properly.
#Install cmake library in Python IDE as well
#Install dlib library as well
#if by chance there is error when running this program then try to install previous version of opencv library.
